# Greetings Slackers
This simple script written in basic Python will allow you to hook into the real time API of Slack and perform a direct message greeting to every new joiner!
Usually this is used to tell new joiners about the network, the guidelines, rules, useful links etc etc

# Q&A

## Q1. How do you change the welcome message?
A1.
To change the welcome message, edit your Heroku variables:
Go to Heroku's Settings, then  where it says `Config Variables` click `Reveal Config Vars` and it will reveal your message and other fields.  This will restart your Heroku instance pretty quickly and apply the changes for you

## Q2. How do I know if it worked?
A2.
After setting up the bot, your welcome message will be displayed to every new user, as soon as a they join your Slack network - as a direct message.
Check the example below:

## Q3. How do I enable the debug channel?
A3.
In the environment variables set DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID to be the ID of your chosen debug channel. That's usually achieved by using `export DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID=<YOUR SLACK CHANNEL ID>` in your CLI. We suggest to make this channel private so not just anyone can join it.
